# 📊 Titanic Insights Dashboard

## 📌 Overview

This project analyzes the **Titanic dataset** using **Excel (Power Query, Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, and Dashboarding techniques)**. The goal is to uncover insights about survival patterns based on **demographics, passenger class, fares, embarkation points, and family composition**.

The final deliverable is an **interactive Excel Dashboard** named **"Data Analysis & Visualizations"**, which allows users to filter, explore, and visualize survival trends with professional-level clarity.

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset used is a cleaned version of the Titanic passenger records containing the following fields:

* `PassengerId` – Unique ID for each passenger
* `Survived` – Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
* `Pclass` – Ticket class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
* `Name` – Passenger’s name
* `Sex` – Gender
* `Age` – Age in years
* `SibSp` – Number of siblings/spouses aboard
* `Parch` – Number of parents/children aboard
* `Ticket` – Ticket number
* `Fare` – Fare paid
* `Cabin` – Cabin number (if known)
* `Embarked` – Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

---

## 🎯 Key Questions Explored

The project investigates **10+ analytical questions**, including:

* Overall survival rate & gender differences
* Class-wise and embarkation-wise survival variations
* Age and family size impact on survival
* Fare analysis across class and survival groups
* Advanced breakdowns (e.g., combined survival by Class × Gender × Embarkation)
* High-fare passengers and their survival outcomes

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques

* **Excel Power Query** → Data cleaning & transformation (missing values, family size calculation, ticket grouping).
* **Pivot Tables** → Aggregations for survival rates, fares, and demographic splits.
* **Pivot Charts** → Interactive visualizations (bar, line, histogram, scatter, pie/donut, treemap, heatmaps).

## 📊 Dashboard Features

The **Visualizations** includes:

* ✅ **Donut & Pie Charts**: Gender split, class distribution, embarkation proportions
* ✅ **Bar & Column Charts**: Survival by class, gender, and embarkation
* ✅ **Line Charts**: Age group survival trends, fare trends by class/embarkation
* ✅ **Heatmaps**: Survival % across multiple categories

---

## 📈 Example Insights

* Women in **1st Class** had significantly higher survival rates than men in **3rd Class**.
* Children (<12 years) had higher chances of survival, especially when traveling with family.
* Passengers who embarked at **Cherbourg (C)** had higher average fares and better survival rates compared to those from **Southampton (S)**.
* Larger families (>4 members) had lower survival chances compared to individuals or small families.

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

* Integration with **Power BI** for richer interactivity.
* Adding **forecasting or probability modeling** in Excel using regression.
* Creating a **multi-level donut chart** for survival vs gender vs class.
